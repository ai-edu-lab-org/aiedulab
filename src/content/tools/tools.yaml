    A visualization tool for analyzing classroom interaction patterns. Processes
    transcript data to reveal the geography of participation — who speaks, when,
    and in what patterns — across a class session.
  educatorNotes: >-
    Powerful for teacher education courses focused on equitable participation and
    discussion facilitation. Pre-service teachers can use it to analyze their own
    teaching practice or study interaction patterns in sample transcripts.

    A transcript visualization tool that transforms conversation data into
    Mondrian-style visual representations, making temporal patterns and
    participation structures immediately visible at a glance.
  educatorNotes: >-
    Pairs well with the Interaction Geography Slicer for a complete classroom
    discourse analysis workflow. The visual output is especially effective for
    helping pre-service teachers see participation imbalances they might
    otherwise miss.

    Google's AI-powered research and note-taking tool that grounds its responses
    in documents you upload. Generates summaries, answers questions, and creates
    audio overviews from your source materials.
  educatorNotes: >-
    Useful for literature review support, synthesizing readings for courses, and
    generating study guides grounded in specific texts. The source-grounding
    feature reduces hallucination risk compared to general-purpose AI assistants.

    questions. Combines web search with language model synthesis to deliver
    research-oriented responses with transparent attribution.
  educatorNotes: >-
    A strong teaching example for discussing AI citation practices and source
    verification. The visible citations make it easier to model critical
    evaluation of AI outputs compared to tools that do not show their sources.
