This video moves beyond the surface-level view of AI as a chatbot and examines three distinct levels at which artificial intelligence is reshaping professional work, ethical frameworks, and privacy expectations. Each level represents a fundamentally different kind of interaction between humans and AI systems, with escalating implications for educators and institutions.

Understanding these levels is essential for teacher educators who need to help future teachers navigate not just today's AI tools, but the trajectory of AI integration across every professional domain. The discussion covers practical implications for educational settings alongside broader societal considerations around ethics and data privacy.
