The dominant public narrative around AI in education oscillates between two poles: utopian visions of AI replacing inefficient human teachers, and dystopian warnings about machines destroying the profession entirely. Both framings share the same flawed assumption — that AI and human educators exist in a zero-sum relationship where one must eventually displace the other. The more productive framing, and the one that aligns with what the research actually tells us about effective teaching and learning, is the co-pilot model: AI as a collaborative tool that augments human judgment rather than replacing it. For teacher educators tasked with preparing professionals for a rapidly shifting landscape, this distinction is not a semantic preference — it is a foundational design principle for how we approach AI integration.

## The Case for the Co-Pilot Model

The co-pilot framing draws on decades of research in human-computer interaction and distributed cognition. The most effective uses of AI in professional contexts are not the ones where the human steps back and lets the machine run; they are the ones where the human remains actively engaged, using AI to extend their capabilities while retaining decision-making authority. In aviation — where the co-pilot metaphor originates — autopilot handles routine cruising, but trained human pilots manage takeoff, landing, and any situation requiring judgment under uncertainty. The parallel to education is direct. AI can handle routine tasks like generating first drafts of rubrics, suggesting differentiated reading materials, or summarizing student feedback patterns. But the pedagogical decisions — what to teach, how to respond to a struggling student, when to deviate from the plan because the class needs something different — remain fundamentally human.

## What This Means for Teacher Education

For teacher educators, adopting the co-pilot model means designing learning experiences where pre-service and in-service teachers practice the specific skill of collaborating with AI rather than delegating to it. This includes learning to evaluate AI-generated lesson plans against established pedagogical criteria, iterating on AI outputs rather than accepting first drafts, and developing the professional judgment to know when AI assistance is appropriate and when it introduces risks — particularly around student data privacy and the reinforcement of biases embedded in training data. These are not abstract concerns; they are the everyday decisions that teachers using AI tools will face.

The co-pilot model also offers a useful corrective to the anxiety many educators feel about AI. When the framing is replacement, every new AI capability feels like a threat. When the framing is collaboration, new capabilities become new possibilities for extending what a skilled educator can accomplish. Teacher educators are uniquely positioned to establish this framing early — shaping how an entire generation of teachers understands the relationship between their professional expertise and AI tools. Getting this framing right may be one of the most consequential things our field does in the next decade.
